\subsection{Expressions}
An expression is something associated with a value.
Every expression are categorized into one of two types
of expressions; terminal or non-terminal expressions.

Terminal expressions are expressions which cannot be 
expanded into a set of terminal and non-terminal expressions.

A non-terminal expression is an expression that can be 
expanded into a set of terminal and non-terminal expressions. \\

\noindent In short, terminal expression always evaluate themselves.
Underneath is a short list of examples of terminal expressions.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Numbers \textbar{} Literals etc.
  \item Variables
\end{itemize}

\noindent A non-terminal expression can have different rules about how to
evaluate it. A short example would be a composition of expressions
like the expression: $2 * 4 + 5$

Eventhough it seems clear that this expression can only evalute to
one thing that is not the case. Depending on the grammar of the language,
the expression could evaluate to two differnt values either 13 or 18.
