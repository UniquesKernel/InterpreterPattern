\subsection{Expressions}
An expression is something associated with a value.
Every expression are categorized into one of two types
of expressions; terminal or non-terminal expressions.

Terminal expressions are expressions which cannot be 
expanded into a set of terminal and non-terminal expressions.

A non-terminal expression is an expression that can be 
expanded into a set of terminal and non-terminal expressions. \\

\noindent In short, terminal expression always evaluate themselves.
Underneath is a short list of examples of terminal expressions.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Numbers \textbar{} Literals etc.
  \item Variables
\end{itemize}

\noindent A non-terminal expression can have different rules about how to
evaluate it. A short example would be a composition of expressions
like the expression: $4 * 5 + 2$
In the above expression, we have operators, which in this case follow the
syntax

\begin{itemize}
\item $<$Expression$>$ $<$Op$>$ $<$Expression$>$
\end{itemize}

\noindent These operator expressions evaluate to a new, in this case, terminal 
expressions.

Eventhough it seems clear that this expression can only evalute to $22$. 
However, depending on the grammar of the language, the expression could evaluate to two different values either 22 or 28.
