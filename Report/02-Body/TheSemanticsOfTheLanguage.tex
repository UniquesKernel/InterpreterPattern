\section{The Semantics}
The language implemented in this report is a short and simple language
that contains only one kind of terminal expression and four operators
for doing mathematical operations $+$, $-$, $*$, and $/$.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Numbers
  \item $+$ \textbar{} $-$ \textbar{} $*$ \textbar{} $/$
\end{itemize}

\noindent The language follow three simple rules and eliminates ambiguity
in a simple way. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item All terminal expressions evaluate to themselves.
  \item All expressions are evaluated left to right
  \item All operators are applied to the two preceding expressions i.e.\\
    $<$Expression$>$ $<$Expression$>$ $<Op>$
\end{enumerate}

These rules ensures clearity in the evaluation of all expressions unlike the
example shown in \autoref{fig:AST_Ambiguity}.
