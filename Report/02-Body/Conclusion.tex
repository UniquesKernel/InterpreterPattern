\section{Conclusion on the Interpreter pattern}
In conclusion, the interpreter is a great way to implement languages
by the use of Abstract Syntax Trees and expressions. I should be
noted that a language can be interpreted as any input that occure
fequently. This could be a unit converter, that convert from meters to
inches.
Depending on the language being implemented it can become a very complex
codebase, very fast because the complexity of languages rise exponentially
as the are expanded.
The Interpreter pattern very bad at handling ill structured data or input
to a system and should be avoided in these cases.
